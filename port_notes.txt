Portfolio Notes

Trying Gatsby for the first time
	-	Lots of documentation about “CSS Modules”. What are they?
		o	Dynamically generated CSS classes and ids with unique identifiers such that even 
when using similarly named identifiers in your CSS file, they are guaranteed to
not step on each other's namespaces.
	-	Modules belong in the same dir as .js component? 
		o	False, they are defined by the relative path on the import line,
	-	Gatsby-browser.js? Just for imports for DOM

“This seems highly customizable, but requires a lot of attention. Aren’t there easier ways? I remember Jason did something cool.”

	-	Navigate to Jason’s GitHub, and discover that he contributes/hosts most of their tutorials. 
	-	Pick up on something about their “starter” sites. Start browsing.
	-	Stumble on one, try to ‘npx gatsby new portfolio <starter-of-my-choice>’. Install completes. ‘npx gatsby develop’ works, but site is not the right one, got basic starter… Hmm..
	-	npx gatsby limited to some starters, git clone from repo https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-strata.
	-	Assumes Gatsby installed. 
		o	‘npm install gatsby’ – Good
		o	 ‘gatsby new portfolio <starter-dir>’ – Nope, you don’t have Gatsby  
		o	Loop here 3 times,
		o	Install gatsby globally ‘npm install gatsby -g’ – Good
		o	‘gatsby new portfolio <starter-dir>’ – Good 


Site runs, looks good. Tear it apart.
Try to modify Gallery.js and React Lightbox.
-	Unsuccessful, keep trying, discover it is naming issue, 
		PastWork.propTypes = {
		    images: PropTypes.array
		};
Needs to be references as images
Here:
       <div>
            {this.renderWork()}
            <Lightbox
                images={this.props.images}
            />
        </div>

Also must be “Lightbox”, (duh)

Try setting “next” function to other photos nested in images[i], fail. Lightbox is a blackbox, nevermind.
Remove Lightbox functionality, change design. Embed links in images. Use Lightbox for format. 
Add new custom Gallery, PastWork.js, with extra object members for more info. 
Site looks good now! Trim the fat
Hmm… How do I force links to open in another tab?
   - <a href="https://github.com/Nixoncole" target="_blank" className="button">
Receive LOTS of warnings about security risks, this is a great feature.
Maybe I’ll fix later
I find it strange that you do not explicitly define routes. I wonder if there are ways to build APIs with Gatsby, but I’ll investigate later.


How do we deploy this bad boi?
 - Looking through Google Domains, not a lot of info. Google Sites is meh, dont want templates. App engine is confusing.
 - Start looking back at notes from Jason - Netlify discovered.
 - Try Netlify... Upload takes forever
 	 - Could not find how to configure DNS on google domains.
 	 - Found youtube tutorial - https://youtu.be/TwykpjPWvoA?t=413
 	 - Just needed to hit button on bottom of Netlify DNS config window to give me names to give to Google.
 	 - Set them up and Boom colenixon.com is ready to RUMBLE
