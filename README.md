# Portfolio Of Cole Nixon


**Portfolio project for PSU CS465 - Full Stack Development**
In this project, I chose to use Gatsby.js as an introduction to React and similar web frameworks.
I chose Gatsby because of the excellent tutorial provided by our guest lecturer https://github.com/jlengstorf

To read through my notes as I explored Gatsby, following some basic tutorials I found on their website, and then 
redesigning/reuphostering a Gatsby "starter" site. 

## Installation

**This site is based off of a starter for Gatsby.js V2.**
